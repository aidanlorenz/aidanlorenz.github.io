Hi! My name is Aidan; I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer at [Arka](https://arka.org/) where I'm currently working on a project funded by [IARPA](https://www.iarpa.gov/) to detect and track lethal debris orbiting Earth. A short general audience write-up about the program can be found [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ultrasmall-space-junk-can-be-an-invisible-satellite-killer-scientists-are/). My Resume is linked below (note that the linked CV is out of date).
